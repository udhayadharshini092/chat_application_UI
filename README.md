Project Summary: Chat Application UI

The Chat Application UI is a modern, responsive interface designed for real-time messaging between users. 
It features clean navigation, attractive design, and essential chat components such as message bubbles, timestamps, and user profiles. 
Users can log in, view contacts, send and receive messages, and toggle between light and dark themes. 
The interface is built to be intuitive, fast, and adaptable for both mobile and desktop use, providing a strong foundation for integrating real-time backend services like Firebase or Socket.io.
